Here, let's develop a forum - to learn how to do it in php and mysql and help each other. It's a project to learn how to code. For beginners who know basic php and mysql syntax.

To work with this, if you haven't yet, set up a WAMP or LAMP or XAMPP on your computer. If you don't know what that is or need help just write a comment or contact me, I'll help you.

So how do we start?

I'll set up a three-folder structure for the start. (We'll probably change that and work that over - I don't really know about MVC, which is "Model View Controller" and a way of setting up your files and functions. This is just for a start.)

Main Folder ->subdirectory "includes" and subdirectory "database".
In the main folder, I will put the file "index.php". This is traditionally the starting page. It will hold the html of the starting / main page and some php code that displays the html we need to display. At the beginning, it will be the page where the categories for the threads are displayed. If you click on a category, a new page will open that shows the threads belonging to the category.
